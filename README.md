# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a Next.js boilerplate curate by [IamDellyson]("https://www.iamdellyson.com").

It uses the following configurations:
- `next-connect` for api route
- `MongoDB and MongoDB client` for database, you can opt for mongoose. 
- `SCSS` for styling and it's well architectured.
